## Getting Started

To use this fork, you need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your machine.  

To use the fork, follow the steps outlined below: 

git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/anchor-todo-list


## Learning Modules

This repository has been structured to facilitate an interactive learning experience, covering both fundamental and advanced Rust concepts, particularly applicable to Solana blockchain development:

- **Basics**: Introduces basic Rust syntax, data types, and operations.
- **Control Flow**: Explores Rust's control flow structures like loops and conditionals.
- **Data Structures**: Examines Rust's array, vector, hash map, and other standard data structures.
- **Advanced Topics**: Delves into more complex aspects of Rust such as structs, enums, error handling, pattern matching with `match`, and method implementation using `impl`.
- **Solana-Specific Examples**: Provides examples and scenarios tailored for Solana development.

These modules are designed to be modular and progressive, making it easy for beginners to start from the basics and gradually move to more complex topics.
